// EventListener class contains a set of call-back functions that will

//
// Note that call-back functions should not run for an extended period of
// time before the function returns, otherwise RocksDB may be blocked.
// For example, it is not suggested to do DB::CompactFiles() (as it may
// run for a long while) or issue many of DB::Put() (as Put may be blocked
// in certain cases) in the same thread in the EventListener callback.
// However, doing DB::CompactFiles() and DB::Put() in another thread is
// considered safe.
//
// [Threading] All EventListener callback will be called using the
// actual thread that involves in that specific event.   For example, it
// is the RocksDB background flush thread that does the actual flush to
// call EventListener::OnFlushCompleted().
